Execution Instructions:

# Extract Features
We have already extracted the features into extracted-stats/, so it is not necessary to run the Python code.

Requirements: python-numpy, python-scipy, python-yaml

Feature aggregation (Python): To extract features from the raw dataset, run:

./features/extract_features.py

The extracted dataset will be in extracted-stats/.

# Classification (Matlab)

cd into the matlab folder.

Run `report`.

The stats will be generated in stats/ and corresponding plots in plots/.

Currently `report` is set to run with data from IPL (All seasons) and T20 International matches, 
for all classifiers (Primal, Dual SVM, Logistic Regression, Ensemble)
using greedy feature subset selection for different sizes.

To generate different combinations of data, add custom configurations in the `configurations`
vector in the following format
{"<dataset>", [<list of features>], <season_start>, <season_end>, <need_cumulative_stats>, <need_per_season_stats>, [<training_percents>], [<classfiers>], [<feature selectors>], [<subset sizes>], "<filename_prefix>"}
where
<dataset> = ipl or bbl or t20
[<list of features>] = vector of features for input, ex) ["-alone-rolling-stats.mat", "-alone-bowling-strike-rate.mat"], or use all_features to include all features
<season_start>	= Integer, first season from which you need to collect data for input, e.g. 2
<season_end>	= Integer, last season till which you need to collect data for input, e.g, 10
<need_cumulative_stats> = Boolean, if the stats need to be cumlative till current season or consider that season
<need_per_season_stats> = Boolean, need stats for each season
[<training_percents>] = Vector, Different percent of data to be used for Training/CV e.g. [.8, .7, .6]
[<classfiers>] = Vector, List of classifiers to use e.g. ["primalsvm", "dualsvm", "logistic", "ensemble"]
[<feature selectors>] = Vector, List of feature selection algorithms to use e.g. ["greedy", "forwardfitting", "myopic"]
[<subset sizes>] = Vector, List of subset size for feature selection e.g. [22, 10, 4]
"<filename_prefix>" = string, prefix of the stat and plot files generated
